// Leetcode #11: Container With Most Water
// You are given an integer array height of length n. There are n vertical lines drawn such that the two endpoints of the line i are at (i, 0) and (i, height[i]).

// Find two lines that together with the x-axis form a container that holds the most water.

// Return the maximum amount of water a container can store.

//input: height = [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]
//output: 49

// Explanation:

// The lines at indices 1 and 8 have heights 8 and 7.

// Distance between them is 8 - 1 = 7

// Area = min(8, 7) * 7 = 49 (maximum possible)
